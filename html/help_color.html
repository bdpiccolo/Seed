Many plot color points or bars based on a user selected variable. This allows the user to view the distribution of the color variable across the samples, effectively adding another dimension to the plot. There are three main options, each of which may be appropriate in different situations. The 'Unique' option generates a different color for each different value of the variable. This option works well up to about ten values. When there are many more values the selected colors are still unique, however, they become difficult to tell apart. The 'Gradient' option may be used when the color variable is continuous. This option selects colors from a gradient. This makes it easy to distinguish between low and high valued colors. The third option is to use color 'Categories'. This option breaks the color variable up into a user selected number of groups. These groups are then given unique colors.
