The bar plot panel displayes a bar plot using variables selected in the sidebar. The value variable defines 
                   the height of the bars. The bar variable defines the bar categories. The bar variable may be reduced to categories
                   by selecting 'Categorize bar variable'. This option breaks the bar variable into categories of equal width.
                   The number of samples represented by each bar is shown in blue. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals, assuming
                   that the samples are independent and normally distributed. NA values are removed from the analysis.
