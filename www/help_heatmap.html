The heatmap and associated sample clustering are based on the taxanomic data. 
                   Only a subset of taxa are used to generate the heatmap. The taxa are ranked by
                   the sum of their abundance data. The highest ranked X microbes are used in the heatmap, where
                   X is selected by the user.
